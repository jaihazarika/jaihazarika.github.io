They condition our thoughts and we don&#x27;t realize it.</p><ol class="nested-bold-list"><li>Action bias:<ul><li><i class="ri-send-plane-2-fill"></i></li><li>The tendency to take action rather than waiting for a better opportunity or more information.</li><li>Example: A student might choose to answer a question quickly, even if they&#x27;re not sure of the answer, rather than taking time to think and risk looking slow.</li></ul></li><li>Anchoring bias:<ul><li><i class="ri-anchor-fill"></i></li><li>The tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions.</li><li>Example: If a store advertises a sale price for a toy, a child might think that&#x27;s the normal price, even if they see it for less somewhere else.</li></ul></li><li>Availability bias:<ul><li><i class="ri-send-plane-2-fill"></i></li><li>The tendency to make decisions based on the most easily accessible or memorable information, rather than the complete set of relevant information.</li><li>Example: If a child hears about a scary news story, they might become afraid of something similar happening to them, even if the odds are very low.</li></ul></li><li>Blind spot bias:<ul><li><i class="ri-send-plane-2-fill"></i></li><li>The tendency to see oneself as being less biased or less susceptible to biases than others.</li><li>Example: A child might think they&#x27;re not biased against someone because of their appearance, but then make assumptions based on stereotypes.</li></ul></li><li>Choice-supportive bias:<ul><li><i class="ri-ram-2-line"></i></li><li>The tendency to remember one&#x27;s choices as better than they actually were.</li><li>Example: A child might remember a toy they chose as being better than it actually was, to justify their decision.</li></ul></li><li>Confirmation bias:<ul><li>The tendency to search, select, analyze, interpret, and recall information in a way that confirms one&#x27;s preexisting beliefs or hypotheses.</li><li>Example: A child might only pay attention to information that supports their belief that a certain animal is scary, and ignore information that contradicts it.</li></ul></li><li>Conservatism bias:<ul><li>The tendency to underestimate the likelihood of future events that are different from those that have occurred in the past.</li><li>Example: A child might think it&#x27;s unlikely to snow in their town because it hasn&#x27;t happened before, even if weather patterns are changing.</li></ul></li><li>Conjunction fallacy:<ul><li>The tendency to assume that specific conditions are more probable than general ones.</li><li>Example: A child might think it&#x27;s more likely that their friend has a red bike and a helmet, than just a red bike.</li></ul></li><li>Curse of knowledge:<ul><li>The tendency to assume that others have the same knowledge and understanding as oneself.</li><li>Example: A child might assume that their friend knows what a &quot;baseball glove&quot; is, because they do.</li></ul></li><li>Decision fatigue:<ul><li>The tendency to make worse decisions at the end of the day due to mental exhaustion.</li><li>Example: A child might choose a less healthy snack in the evening, because they&#x27;re too tired to make a better choice.</li></ul></li><li>Declinism:<ul><li>The tendency to believe that things were better in the past and will be worse in the future.</li><li>Example: A child might think that old cartoons were better than the ones made today.</li></ul></li><li>Dunning-Kruger effect:<ul><li>The tendency for individuals who are incompetent in a particular domain to overestimate their own competence and the competence of others who are equally or more competent than themselves.</li><li>Example: A child who is new to a game might think they&#x27;re just as good as the more experienced players.</li></ul></li><li>Empathy gap:<ul><li>The tendency to underestimate the influence or strength of feelings, in oneself or others.</li><li>Example: A child might not realize how scared they would be in a dark room, until they&#x27;re actually in one.</li></ul></li><li>Endowment effect:<ul><li>The tendency to value something more highly simply because one owns it.</li><li>Example: A child might not want to trade their favorite toy, even if they&#x27;re offered something they like just as much.</li></ul></li><li>Experimenter&#x27;s bias:<ul><li>The tendency for researchers to unconsciously influence the results of their experiments.</li><li>Example: A child might accidentally give more attention to a plant they&#x27;re watering, causing it to grow more than the other plants.</li></ul></li><li>Familiarity bias:<ul><li>The tendency to prefer things that are familiar over things that are unfamiliar.</li><li>Example: A child might choose to read the same book over and over, instead of trying a new one.</li></ul></li><li>Fundamental attribution error:<ul><li>The tendency to attribute other people&#x27;s behavior to their character rather than their situation.</li><li>Example: A child might think their friend is mean, instead of realizing they&#x27;re just having a bad day.</li></ul></li><li>Gambler&#x27;s fallacy:<ul><li>The tendency to believe that past events will influence future ones, such as believing that a coin toss is &quot;due&quot; for a certain outcome after a series of opposite outcomes.</li><li>Example: A child might think that if they flip a coin and it lands on heads five times in a row, it&#x27;s more likely to land on tails the next time.</li></ul></li><li>Halo effect:<ul><li>The tendency to make broad generalizations based on one trait or characteristic.</li><li>Example: A child might assume that because their teacher is nice, they&#x27;re also good at their job.</li></ul></li><li>Hindsight bias:<ul><li>The tendency to believe, after an event has occurred, that one would have predicted or expected the outcome beforehand.</li><li>Example: A child might think they knew all along that their team would win the game, even if they were nervous beforehand.</li></ul></li><li>Illusion of control:<ul><li>The tendency to believe that one has more control over events than is actually the case.</li><li>Example: A child might think they can make their favorite team win by wearing their lucky shirt.</li></ul></li><li>Illusion of validity:<ul><li>The tendency to overestimate the accuracy of one&#x27;s predictions based on insufficient evidence.</li><li>Example: A child might think they can predict which team will win a game, based on their initial impressions of the players.</li></ul></li><li>Illusory superiority:<ul><li>The tendency to overestimate one&#x27;s abilities relative to others.</li><li>Example: A child might think they&#x27;re the best artist in their class, even if they haven&#x27;t seen everyone else&#x27;s artwork.</li></ul></li><li>Information bias:<ul><li>The tendency to seek out information even when it is not useful or necessary.</li><li>Example: A child might spend too much time researching a topic, instead of starting their assignment.</li></ul></li><li>Irrational escalation:<ul><li>The tendency to continue investing in a decision, even when it is clear that it is not the best option.</li><li>Example: A child might keep trying to build a tower with blocks, even though it keeps falling over.</li></ul></li><li>Just-world hypothesis:<ul><li>The tendency to believe that the world is fundamentally fair, and that people get what they deserve.</li><li>Example: A child might think that a person who is poor must have done something wrong to deserve it.</li></ul></li><li>Loss aversion:<ul><li>The tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.</li><li>Example: A child might be more upset about losing a toy than happy about getting a new one.</li></ul></li><li>Mere exposure effect:<ul><li>The tendency to prefer things that are familiar, even if one cannot consciously remember having encountered them before.</li><li>Example: A child might prefer a song they&#x27;ve heard before, even if they don&#x27;t remember where they heard it.</li></ul></li><li>Negativity bias:<ul><li>The tendency to give more weight to negative experiences than positive ones.</li><li>Example: A child might remember a time they were scolded more than a time they were praised.</li></ul></li><li>Normalcy bias:<ul><li>The tendency to underestimate the likelihood of a disaster or emergency, and to assume that things will continue as they are.</li><li>Example: A child might not take a fire drill seriously, because they&#x27;ve never experienced a real fire.</li></ul></li><li>Optimism bias:<ul><li>The tendency to overestimate the probability of positive outcomes and underestimate the probability of negative outcomes.</li><li>Example: A child might think they&#x27;ll get a perfect score on a test, even if they didn&#x27;t study.</li></ul></li><li>Overconfidence bias:<ul><li>The tendency to be more confident in one&#x27;s abilities or predictions than is warranted.</li><li>Example: A child might think they can ride a bike without training wheels, even if they&#x27;re not ready yet.</li></ul></li><li>Planning fallacy:<ul><li>The tendency to underestimate how long it will take to complete a task.</li><li>Example: A child might think they can build a model airplane in an hour, but it takes them three hours.</li></ul></li><li>Projection bias:<ul><li>The tendency to assume that others share the same beliefs, values, and preferences as oneself.</li><li>Example: A child might assume that their friend likes the same flavor of ice cream as they do.</li></ul></li><li>Recency bias:<ul><li>The tendency to give more weight to recent events or information, and to underestimate the importance of earlier events.</li><li>Example: A child might think their most recent test score is more important than their earlier ones.</li></ul></li><li>Regression fallacy:<ul><li>The tendency to assume that a single event is part of a larger pattern, rather than being an isolated occurrence.</li><li>Example: A child might think they&#x27;re good at basketball because they made a few shots in a row, even if they&#x27;re not actually good at it.</li></ul></li><li>Restraint bias:<ul><li>The tendency to overestimate one&#x27;s ability to resist temptation or make good decisions in the future.</li><li>Example: A child might think they can resist eating candy before dinner, but then give in to the temptation.</li></ul></li><li>Salience bias:<ul><li>The tendency to focus on the most prominent or memorable features of a situation, rather than the most relevant ones.</li><li>Example: A child might focus on the color of a toy, rather than its educational value.</li></ul></li><li>Self-serving bias:<ul><li>The tendency to take credit for successes and blame external factors for failures.</li><li>Example: A child might take credit for getting a good grade on a test, but blame the teacher for getting a bad grade.</li></ul></li><li>Sunk cost fallacy:<ul><li>The tendency to continue investing in a decision because of the resources already committed, rather than making a rational decision based on the current situation.</li><li>Example: A child might continue playing a game they&#x27;re not enjoying, because they&#x27;ve already spent a lot of time on it.</li></ul></li><li>Survivorship bias:<ul><li>The tendency to focus on the successful outcomes, and to ignore the failures or less successful outcomes.</li><li>Example: A child might only hear about successful athletes, and think that&#x27;s the only outcome of playing sports.</li></ul></li><li>Temporal discounting:<ul><li>The tendency to value immediate rewards more highly than future rewards.</li><li>Example: A child might choose to eat a candy bar now, instead of saving it for later.</li></ul></li><li>Thought-action fusion:<ul><li>The tendency to believe that thinking about a negative event is morally equivalent to causing it to happen.</li><li>Example: A child might think that thinking about a bad grade will make it happen.</li></ul></li><li>Zero-risk bias:<ul><li>The tendency to prefer options that eliminate all risk, even if it means accepting a lower overall benefit.</li><li>Example: A child might choose to stay home instead of going on a trip, because they&#x27;re afraid of getting lost.</li></ul></li><li>Anchoring and adjustment heuristic:<ul><li>The tendency to make estimates based on the first piece of information encountered, and then adjust based on additional information.</li><li>Example: A child might estimate that a group of 20 animals is more than 50, because they initially thought there were more than 50.</li></ul></li><li>Availability heuristic:<ul><li>The tendency to make judgments about the likelihood of events based on how easily they can be brought to mind.</li><li>Example: A child might think that getting lost in a store is more likely than getting lost in a park, because they can easily remember times they got lost in a store.</li></ul></li><li>Representativeness heuristic:<ul><li>The tendency to make judgments about the probability of an event based on how closely it resembles a prototype or stereotype.</li><li>Example: A child might think that a person with glasses is smart, because that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ve seen in movies and TV shows.</li></ul></li><li>Simulation heuristic:<ul><li>The tendency to make decisions based on mental simulations of possible outcomes, rather than on actual data or evidence.</li><li>Example: A child might decide not to ride a bike because they imagine themselves falling off, even if they&#x27;ve never fallen off before.</li></ul></li><li>Substitution heuristic:<ul><li>The tendency to substitute a difficult question with an easier one when making a decision.</li><li>Example: A child might choose a flavor of ice cream based on the color, instead of their actual preference.</li></ul></li><li>Tallying heuristic:<ul><li>The tendency to make decisions based on a mental tally of positive and negative experiences or outcomes.</li><li>Example: A child might choose a restaurant based on the number of times they&#x27;ve had a good meal there, rather than the quality of the food.</li></ul></li></ol></section></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__"
